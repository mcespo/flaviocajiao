        Hello. This is the base layout for the new website. This is not a live
        site and will not be a live site until we purchase a URL, upload photos,
        replace the copy, confirm hours, and until you approve the final design.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, let's review the content and make changes as you provide text
        to swap on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will use this section to talk about the offered services at the
        clinic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>As an additional note:</b> You should use this additional area to
        discuss what the office has been doing to make the offices safe during
        the Covid pandemic.
